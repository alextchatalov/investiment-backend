# This changelog represents the state of the database schema prior to version
# 2.3.  The schema was previously generated at runtime by Hibernate for the
# sake of convenience, but that makes it difficult to version properly and
# migrate between versions.
# This changelog was generated based on an existing database and modified
# slightly to be more generic.  It can be used to initialize a new database
# from scratch, but it is also intended to be able to synchronize an
# existing database with Liquibase's changelog.
